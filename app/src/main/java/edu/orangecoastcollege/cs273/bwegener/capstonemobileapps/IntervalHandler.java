/**
 * Helper class used to handle intervals expressed in either ratios/fractions or cents for the purpose
 * of frequency calculations.
 *
 * From Wikipedia:
 *
 * In music theory, an interval is the difference between two pitches. An interval may be described
 * as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent
 * pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such
 * as in a chord.
 *
 * In physical terms, an interval is the ratio between two sonic frequencies. For example, any two
 * notes an octave apart have a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that successive increments of pitch
 * by the same interval result in an exponential increase of frequency, even though the human ear
 * perceives this as a linear increase in pitch. For this reason, intervals are often measured in
 * cents, a unit derived from the logarithm of the frequency ratio.
 *
 * The cent is a logarithmic unit of measure used for musical intervals. Twelve-tone equal
 * temperament divides the octave into 12 semitones of 100 cents each. Typically, cents are used
 * to express small intervals, or to compare the sizes of comparable intervals in different
 * tuning systems, and in fact the interval of one cent is too small to be heard between
 * successive notes.
